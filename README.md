# GOAT Notes 🐐🧠

GOAT Notes is a production ready, full stack note taking app that integrates OpenAI for intelligent note interaction. Built entirely from scratch, it demonstrates secure authentication, dynamic server side actions, scalable database architecture, and a polished UI. All using a modern, professional grade tech stack.

This was not a clone or a copied repo. I personally wrote every line of code, following a professional tutorial only as a guide. I paused frequently to understand the why, debugged every bug myself, and made intentional decisions throughout. GOAT Notes reflects not just what I know but how I think and how I work.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built GOAT Notes to prove I could ship a real product, not just follow tutorials. My goal was to understand full stack architecture end-to-end, from auth and data modeling to secure server actions and AI integration. Every part of this app taught me how to think like an engineer: breaking problems into parts, reading docs, building with intention, and debugging under pressure.

I’m now looking to bring that same discipline, curiosity, and drive to a real world development team.

## 📁 Folder Structure Highlights

/src/app/ – App Router layout and routes  
/src/actions/ – Server side logic (notes, users, AI)  
/src/components/ui/ – Reusable shadcn styled components  
/src/db/ – Prisma schema + migrations  
/src/openai/ – OpenAI integration logic  
/middleware.ts – Auth session handling

## 🧰 Next Steps

I’m actively applying for entry level roles and freelance work. If you’re a hiring engineer, CTO, or founder looking for someone who can deliver, learn fast, and own their work, I’d love to talk.
